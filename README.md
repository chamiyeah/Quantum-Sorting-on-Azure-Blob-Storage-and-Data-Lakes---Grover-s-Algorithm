# Quantum Grover Algorithm for Azure Blob Storage

This repository contains a Quantum Grover algorithm implemented in Q# and integrated with Azure Blob Storage. The algorithm is designed to search for a marked item in an unsorted Azure Blob Storage, using Grover's quantum search algorithm.

## Prerequisites

Before running the quantum algorithm, ensure you have the following:

- **Azure Quantum Workspace**: Create an Azure Quantum Workspace using the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

- **Azure Storage Account**: Set up an Azure Storage Account with a Blob Container where the unsorted data is stored.

- **Quantum Development Kit (QDK)**: Install the Quantum Development Kit, which includes the Q# compiler and runtime. You can download it from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/).
