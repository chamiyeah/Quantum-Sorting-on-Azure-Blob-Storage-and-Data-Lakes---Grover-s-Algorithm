# Quantum Grover Algorithm for Azure Blob Storage

This repository contains a Quantum Grover algorithm implemented in Q# and integrated with Azure Blob Storage. The algorithm is designed to search for a marked item in an unsorted Azure Blob Storage, using Grover's quantum search algorithm.

## Prerequisites

Before running the quantum algorithm, ensure you have the following:

- **Azure Quantum Workspace**: Create an Azure Quantum Workspace using the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

- **Azure Storage Account**: Set up an Azure Storage Account with a Blob Container where the unsorted data is stored.

- **Quantum Development Kit (QDK)**: Install the Quantum Development Kit, which includes the Q# compiler and runtime. You can download it from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/).

## Quantum Algorithm Overview

The Quantum Grover algorithm is designed to search for a marked item in an unsorted database. In this example, the marked item is represented by the state |1⟩. The algorithm uses Grover's iterations to amplify the amplitude of the marked state, increasing the probability of measuring the marked item.

## Q# Code Breakdown

### Marking Oracle

The `MarkingOracle` operation in Q# flips the sign of the amplitude of the marked state. This is where the quantum search condition is applied.

```qsharp
operation MarkingOracle(qubits : Qubit[]) : Unit is Adj {
    // Apply the oracle logic to mark the solution states.
    // This logic depends on the specific structure of your database and how you encode your items.
    // For simplicity, let's assume the marked item is |1⟩.
    X(qubits[0]);
}
```

### Diffusion Operator

The `DiffusionOperator` operation implements the Grover diffusion operator, which amplifies the amplitude of the desired state.

```qsharp
operation DiffusionOperator(qubits : Qubit[]) : Unit is Adj {
    H(qubits);
    ApplyPauliXor([PauliX(q) | q in qubits], qubits);
    H(qubits);
}
